What is it?
==================
Apache Flex 4.6 library which contains unified framework and spark and no MX components.

Purpose
==================
Tweak the framework and experiment for optimizing the SDK.

Intructions on how to use it
==================
1) Download the sources and import it in Flash Builder.
2) Create a new Flex project
3) On "Build Paths" wizard step, choose "Spark only" and click "Finished"
4) Go to Project menu and choose properties
5) Under "Flex Build Path" expand SDK that you are using (I recommend SDK 4.6)
6) Remove the following : "framework.swc", "spark.swc", "sparkskins.swc"
7) Add the imported library (SparkOnly)
8) Enjoy!

Notes
==================
Assets.swf contains MX graphics. I've left it there since I'm planning to use those symbols when I'll construct the missing MX components for Spark (
ColorPicker, DateChooser, DateField , LinkButton , Menu , PopUpButton , VideoDisplay , VideoPlayer , ProgressBar , SWFLoader , TabNavigator , ViewStack , Tree , etc)
